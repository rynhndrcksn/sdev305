# SDEV 305

## Description:

A repo for my Software Development 305 class that focused on PHP and databases. The work involved creating a website, database, and functioning backend for a real client. The classroom was divided up into groups of 3-4 students, where we held multiple meetings a week, used SCRUM methodology, and would do follow ups with the client and reshift our focus depending on client needs.

Client required a website that had a form for people to request financial assistance. We also implemented an admin page for them to view all form submissions.

## IDE:
* PHPStorm
